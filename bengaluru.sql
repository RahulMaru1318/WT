The Beda Brigadeâ€™s Satyagraha has sent a powerful message to the governmentâ€™s adamant stance on the project\r\n\r\nThe one good thing the steel flyover has done for the city so far is unite its people into a force the government will have to reckon with. At Freedom Park on Sunday, Bengalureans poured in like never before for the Satyagraha scheduled in protest against the governmentâ€™s flyover project that will doom 800-odd trees. Unlike political rallies, no gifts were promised, no buses were arranged, no food or liquor was served. And yet, hundreds turned up.\r\n\r\nThe Gandhian protest was set to begin at 9 am, but Freedom Park was full even before that. Hundreds of citizens gathered at the venue to participate in the fast. The protesters included not only activists but celebrities, musicians, artists, industry leaders, stay-at-home moms, and even schoolchildren. Their message was so clear, even this 9-year-old could get it: â€œTrees give us oxygen and we should be taking care of them. I have come here to protest against the flyover because it is a holiday and I donâ€™t want them to cut down the trees,â€ said Medhini Balachandran.\r\n\r\nThe Bangalore Development Authorityâ€™s decision to build a Rs1,791-crore steel flyover from Basaveshwara Circle to Hebbal flyover has become a bone of contention between like-minded Bengalureans and the government. Despite widespread protests against the project over serious environmental repercussions, the government has stayed unmoved.\r\n\r\nNS Mukunda, founder president of Citizenâ€™s Action Forum, said the government canâ€™t bully the people anymore. â€œIt canâ€™t continue to destroy the cityâ€™s green cover in the name of development. For long, citizens have allowed the state to carry out these infrastructure works, but most of them have failed. Itâ€™s time we put a stop to it,â€ he said.\r\nProtesters were of the view that consultation with citizens should become compulsory before any development project is taken up in the city because it is their future that was in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nRamesh B had come to the venue on foot, all the way from Chamarajapet. â€œThe first week of November is over and the heat is still unbelievable. This is because in the name of development, the green cover of the city has been plundered. We donâ€™t want to be in news like New Delhi [whose air quality has gone beyond alarming]. This is the time we put our foot down,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe activist said it was time to introspect. â€œWe want to prove it to them [the government] that this is our city and we wonâ€™t let anyone take it for granted. If required, we will up the ante, but wonâ€™t allow any more trees to be cut over whims and fancies of the government,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nKH Ramalinga Reddy, an RTI activist present at the venue, said: â€œI have been fighting agaiÂ­nst corruption for long and I can vouch for it that development has become the biggest alibi for corruption and by this movement, citizens have made it clear that we wonâ€™t sit idle over the issue. When we say â€˜steel flyover bedaâ€™, we mean it. If the state government can be adamant, then so can we.â€\r\n\r\nThe gathering at Freedom Park has sent a strong message to the government.

The trial run of cards will be done for a period of one month. The smart card would cost Rs 25 and the BMTC is contemplating to facilitate top-up of the card up to Rs 10,000. However, no call has been taken yet. Unlike smart cards issued by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) for commuters of namma metro, the cards will have photos of city bus passengers, their name, address and other details.\r\n\r\nâ€œTesting of smart cards will be done on a few routes which are operated from Shantinagar bus station. In a few days, we will finalise the routes for testing. For the trial, we will use a limited numbers of cards. We are also issuing some of the cards to our staff who are using city buses for commuting. Issuance of smart cards will help passengers in many ways. Smart cards can be for daily passes, monthly passes and to purchase tickets. In addition, these smart cards can be used as E-purse for other transactions.â€ said MD of BMTC Ekroop Caur.\r\n\r\nThe BMTC has already procured 10,000 electronic ticketing machines for the purpose. For over six months, conductors have been using ETMs to issue the tickets.\r\nâ€œNow an entire fleet of BMTC uses ETMs to issue tickets. Conductors are happy with the change as it become very convenient for them. Before going for full-fledged operations of smart cards, conductors will be trained, â€œsaid an official.\r\n\r\nThe BMTC is hoping that over 7 lakh passengers who are at present using various types of passes would shift to smart cards initially and the number would rise gradually. Close to 52 lakh people use city buses to commute.\r\n\r\nHowever, issues of smart cards for students who avail student passes will happen only in the next academic year. â€œIn the current academic year, over 4 lakh students are already using student concessional bus passes, so we cannot issue new cards to them. We will issue the smart cards to students only in the next academic year, â€ said an official.\r\n\r\nPeople who are using both metro and city buses to commute may have to wait for many more months as both the institutions are yet to facilitate the required infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIt can be recalled that the BMTC had planned to introduce smart card project in the last year itself.\r\n\r\nLater, it fixed September 2016 as the deadline. It is said that due to several security issues such as monetary transactions involved, more time was sought by the service provider.\r\n\r\n', 1478525792, '1478525792.jpg', 'city'),

The entire month saw a total of 60,569 vehicles registered.\r\n\r\nPresident, Transportation Research Group of India, Ashish Verma, said, â€œThe increased vehicle population is alarming. No amount of infrastructure you create could match the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. A majority of the vehicles registered in the city are used for personalised transport. The state government, instead of focusing on steel flyover, should think about speedy completion of a mass transit project like the metro. There is a need induct a number buses into the fleet of BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation) and providing dedicated lanes on the roads.â€\r\n\r\nThe concern is justified. At present, the city has 64,84,354 registered vehicles (till August); however, officials maintain that the vehicle population has already crossed 66 lakh. The city already has one vehicle per two persons. Transport department officials said that at this rate of growth, by August 2017, the vehicle population would cross the 70 lakh mark.\r\n\r\nTo compare with last year, till August a total of 57,75,944 vehicles were registered in the city, showing an increase of 7.08 lakh vehicles this year.\r\n\r\nIn the last one year, on an average, 1,940 vehicles per day got registered daily.\r\n\r\nTransport minister Ramalinga Reddy said, â€œThere is no proposal before us to restrict registrations of new vehicles. Restricting registration of vehicles is impractical as it cannot be implemented. If registrations are restricted in the city limits, people will go to RTOs on the city outskirts or in neighbouring districts like Kolar, Ramanagara and others to register their vehicles and ply them on city roads. The city traffic or civic bodies should come up with some innovative plans to de-congest the city.â€\r\n\r\nOf the total number of vehicles registered in Bengaluru, more than 70 per cent are two-wheelers. There are 44,90,827 two-wheelers; till August 2015, it was 39, 93,874.\r\n\r\nIn the last one year, close to five lakh two-wheelers were registered in the city. Registration of cars in the last one year increased by 1.28 lakh. A total of 11.26 lakh cars were registered till last August, which increased to 12.55 lakh till August 2016.\r\n\r\nThe increased rate of vehicle registrations has helped generate revenue more than what the state government had fixed. In the financial year 2014-15, the state government had fixed a revenue target of Rs 4,397 crore, against which Rs 4,608 crore was generated by the transport department. In 2015-16, the target set was Rs 4,800 crore, while the department exceeded the target by generating Rs 4,911 crore.\r\n\r\nSG Neginhal, former principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), said, â€œThe pollution levels have already increased in the city due to more emission of carbon dioxide and other dangerous gases. Increased vehicle pollution and the diminishing green cover in the city could lead to various health complications including asthma, cancer and others. Increased pollution is also posing a serious threat to the fauna. The state government should give an impetus to registration of vehicles which are environment-friendly, like electric vehicles. There is a need to curb movement of vehicles which are more than ten years old to bring down pollution levels.â€\r\n', 1478526325, '1478526325.jpg', 'city'),

By end of November, the entire city will be rendered pothole-free using a different approach, but with public and technological accountability. There will be no inviting of tenders, and the corporators of respective wards will be allowed to directly choose their own contractors to carry out the works. The entire process is said to be accountable as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) engineers will have to take â€˜beforeâ€™ and â€˜afterâ€™ pictures of the spot and upload them on the BBMP website along with the money estimates for the work, as proof of completed works. Moreover, citizens too can take pictures of unattended potholes close to their residences and upload them on BBMPâ€™s website, and those will be attended to by the engineers.\r\n\r\nThe BBMP engineers will be trained in the process over a week, and once the training is done the pothole-filling work would be completed within two weeks.\r\n\r\nâ€œI do not want to see any potholes in the city after that. Once the deadline passes, strict action will be taken against the engineers responsible if any potholeis seen,â€ BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said.\r\n\r\nHe has obtained from the state government an exemption from inviting tenders to take up the pothole-filling works. â€œI had sought an exemption under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act which allows any agency to proceed with civil works without inviting tenders. As potholes affect taxpayers, the state government has granted an exemption. According to the act, pothole-filling works up to Rs 10 lakh can be executed without inviting tenders,â€ Prasad told Bangalore Mirror.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are trying to build a system which could help us provide a pothole-free city. Till today, what was happening was that each ward spent Rs 10 lakh only for pothole-filling. But at times, that could even go up to Rs 20 lakh. This money could have spent only for filling 100 potholes; but what about the remaining potholes which were not attended to?â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThis approach with accountability is expected to do away with the practice of bogus bills that were made by ward-level BBMP engineers in the past in the name of pothole-filling when amounts over Rs 10 lakh were spent on pothole-filling.\r\n\r\nPrasadâ€™s idea is to empower the corporators by giving them the chance to select a known contractor to undertake pothole-filling work in their respective wards.\r\nHowever, wards have various schemes undertaken simultaneously. But when the road asphalting work is undertaken in a particular ward under Nagarothana scheme then such roads would be excluded from the pothole filling exercise as the road levelling exercise would include pothole-filling by default.\r\n\r\nPrasad said only those roads which do not have such default liability periods are to be estimated for the pothole-filling related issues and these need to be estimated only after the ward engineer concerned walks through the entire ward and counts the number of potholes.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe engineer has to visit the potholes and take a pictures of potholes with the resident who stays closest to it. The same picture will be uploaded in BBMPâ€™s server along with the landmark (the location of the closest residence). Once the pothole is filled, another picture needs to be taken and uploaded. The same can be visible to everyone and all the details of the said potholes along with the estimates will be updated,â€ he explained.\r\n\r\nThe 100 wards falling under core Bengaluru are granted Rs 2 crore each, while the other 98 wards (outer areas) have been granted Rs 3 crore each. Of these amounts, the tender invitation-exempted budget for pothole-filling is Rs 10 lakh.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, one round of training was conducted for all chief engineers and executive engineers. â€œOne round of training is over. Within the next two days another round of training would be undertaken for assistant executive engineers and ward level engineers. They will be explained how to work in the wards for providing pothole-free roads,â€ said Prasad.\r\n', 1478526448, '1478526448.jpg', 'city'),
